Introduction:
This project consists of a comprehensive (possibly the largest) database of IEM's (In-Ear Monitors).
Each IEM has the following data:

- IEM Name
- Brand
- Price ($)
- ANC Capability
- Sensitivity (dB/mW)
- Impedance (Î©)
- # of Drivers
- Driver Configuration
- Connection Type
- Microphone
- IP Rating	
- Measurement(s)
- Misc Measurement(s) (DSP Modes)
- # of Measurements
- Contributing Reviewers

From which the following can be calculated:

- Average Measurement
- Preference %
- Average  Error (dB)
- Slope of Error
- STDEV of Error
- Variance
